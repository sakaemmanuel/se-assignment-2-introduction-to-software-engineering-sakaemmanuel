# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

A branch of computer science that deals with the development of applications 

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Sotware engineering is extended over the entire lifecycle of the software to emphasize a structured and methodical approach to software development while SDLC is a step by step process of developing a software and includes planning, analysis, implementation and maintenance

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

A full SDLC has 7 basic stages: Planning, requirements, design and prototype, software development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. 
An Agile framework emphasizes iterative development.
Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before proceeding to the next, making it less adaptable to change

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile is open to adaptation and welcomes changes of direction, even in later phases of the project making it more flexible in budget.
Waterfall is a linear project progression, so it's best suited for projects with a defined end goal.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements. It ensures software meets stakeholders' needs. Proper management improves project clarity, reduces errors, and aligns expectations.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

 It facilitates easier management and understanding of complex systems by breaking them down into digestible parts. It also helps make your code more organized, reusable, and maintainable.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Software testing is crucial because it  ensures that the software works correctly before release, and that it adheres to industry standards, regulations, and other critical compliance requirements.

In software testing, there are four levels of testing, such as:

Unit testing: This is the first level of testing that determines whether or not software components fulfill functionalities.
Integration testing: This is the second level of testing that verifies data flow from one module to another.
System testing: This is the third level of testing that examines both functional and non-functional testing requirements.
Acceptance Testing: This is the fourth level of testing that verifies that the requirements have been me

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
Importance of version control systems is that it allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, each making their changes in a controlled and isolated manner. This prevents overwriting and conflicting changes.
Examples are GitHub, GitLab, Beanstalk, Microsoft Team etc.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Software project manager's responsibilities are to establish the project objectives, coordinate the project's internal and external teams and monitor the project's key performance indicators.

Challenges faced in software projects are such as Lack of communication, Lack of clear goals and success criteria, Budgeting issues, Inadequate skills of team members etc

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs.
 There are several types of maintenance, including corrective (fixing defects), adaptive (adapting to the environment), perfective (enhancing attributes), and preventive (preventing problems).
Software maintenance is essential because it helps to modify and update software applications after deployments to fix bugs and improve system performance. It is also required to keep software operational and meet user needs over time.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Privacy, accuracy, property, accessibility, and effects on quality of life, are all issues that must be considered in developing and delivering computer software systems.
Education and training are key to promoting ethical practices in software development. Organizations should foster a culture of ethics, ensuring that ethical standards are communicated and upheld at all levels.

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
